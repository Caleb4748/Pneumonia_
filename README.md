# Pneumonia_ Study

This project explores pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. The notebook `pneumonet_pro_plus.ipynb` trains a MobileNetV2 model. Additional cells demonstrate how to train a simple CNN on the same data splits.

The comparison table at the end of the notebook lists baseline metrics from MobileNetV2 and placeholders for the simple CNN. Running the new cells requires downloading the chest_Xray dataset to `./chest_Xray`.
